# Library-Book-Recommendation-Chatbot-Using-Rasa-NLU

In  response  to  the  growing  demand  for streamlined  library  management,  this  project  introduces  an innovative  system  centered  around  a  friendly  and  intuitive chatbot. The motivation behind this endeavor stems from the need for a cost-effective, personalized recommendation system tailored specifically to local library collections. By harnessing the power of Rasa NLU, a conversational agent was developed to seamlessly assist library visitors in discovering their next favorite read. Through a meticulous integration of Rasa NLU's capabilities,  including  custom  actions  for  book  and  author inquiries and entity extraction for genres and descriptions, the chatbot effectively navigates user queries within the library's context. With a keen focus on precision and user engagement, the system's DIETClassifier ensures accurate intent recognition, facilitating seamless interaction and meaningful responses. The project outcomes underscore the chatbot's ability to understand nuanced requests, provide tailored book recommendations, and enhance  user  experience  within  library  environments.  This initiative serves as a testament to the transformative potential of open-source AI tools in enhancing public service offerings and fostering  greater  accessibility  to  library  resources
